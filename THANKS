I would like to thank the creator of the lambda package,
Alan Jeffrey, for making a splendid package that made this package
possible.

For discussions and alpha-testing I send my thanks to Guido
Governatori - some of his ideas have already been implemented; the
rest? Time will show.

Thanks to Harri Haanpaa for finding a nasty bug in the castling
routine.

A big thank goes to Dirk BÃ¤chle for adding the Informator symbols to
the fonts and for removing a couple of nasty bugs as well as improving
some of the commands.

I thank Ulrike Fischer for the tremendous work she has done with
regards to improving the way fonts are handled by the skak package,
not to mention the significant amount of bugs she has found and in
many cases fixed.

Thanks for reporting various bugs goes to Ingo Sander, Andreas Wilm,
Ulrich Dirr and Niels Stargardt.
